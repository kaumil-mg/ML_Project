# ML_Project
Machine Learning project guided by Krish Naik in Physics Wallah

## In this Project i am gonna learn about ML steps to create a project here you'll get to know about 5 major stuff as below
- Data Collection : Dataset is Algerial forest fire :
    
    -Data Set Information:

    The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

    122 instances for each region.

The period from June 2012 to September 2012.
The dataset includes 11 attribues and 1 output attribue (class)
The 244 instances have been classified into fire(138 classes) and not fire (106 classes) classes.


- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Purpose:

Understand the underlying structure of the data.
Identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies.
Gain insights that will help in the feature engineering and model building process.
Activities:

Summary Statistics: Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and other summary statistics.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
Missing Data Analysis: Identify and quantify missing values.
Outlier Detection: Detect and understand outliers in the data.
Correlation Analysis: Assess relationships between variables using correlation matrices or pair plots.
Tools:

Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

- Feature Engineering (FE) :

Purpose:

Create and select the most relevant features to improve the performance of machine learning models.
Transform raw data into meaningful features that better represent the underlying problem.
Activities:

Feature Creation: Generate new features from existing data, such as combining features, extracting date/time components, or using domain knowledge to create meaningful features.
Feature Transformation: Apply mathematical transformations to features, such as scaling, normalization, logarithms, and polynomial transformations.
Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features using techniques such as variance thresholding, correlation analysis, or more advanced methods like recursive feature elimination.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using methods like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.
Handling Missing Values: Impute missing values or create new features indicating the presence of missing values.
Tools:

Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn
